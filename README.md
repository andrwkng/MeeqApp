# Meeq
Meeq is an android native, GPL-licensed, [Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy)
app built in Kotlin and Jetpack compose.

Unlike many CBT apps, it's fairly unbiased in what you use it for; it doesn't ask about you
to do depression-specific CBT exercises. That makes it fairly quick and discreet to use, especially in a public
setting.
